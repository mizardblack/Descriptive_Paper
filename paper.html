                    Spun Chair</a> is designed by Thomas Heatherwick and manufactured by Magis in
                2010. It is a
                spinning-top-liked chair made out of rotationally molded polyethylene. The material is strong enough to
                hold
                up to 220 pounds of object on it. The size of the chair is 36” for width, 36" for depth, and 26" for
                height.
                Magis Spun Chairs sale for $ 895.00 and come with four colors: red, white, dark purple, and grey
                anthracite.
                Several of the samples of Magis Spun Chairs are currently displayed in Cooper Hewitt Smithsonian Design
                Museum.

            </div>
            <div id="content"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycarbonate">Polycarbonates</a> are a group of
                thermoplastic polymers containing carbonate groups in their
                chemical structures. Polycarbonates used in engineering are strong, tough materials, and some grades are
                optically transparent. They are easily worked, molded, and thermoformed. Thus the chairs are light and
                strong.

            <div id="content">These black chairs
                are displayed in the empty corridor of the basement, echoing the grey carpet and the pure white wall.
                It's
                good to see </br></br>
                Just like a toy top, the bottom of the chair is also cone-shaped. Gradually widen upward, there is a
                tapered
                waist in the middle, like the bottleneck of a vase. Above the waist, in the center of the trumpet-like
                top,
                there is an inward depression, which is where people sit. The fine texture of the chair surface is
                caused by
                the polyethylene winded layer by layer.</br></br>
                The chairs displayed in the corridor not only serve as furniture for rest, but also as decorations and
                toys.
                Although spun chairs have many functions, their design is very simple: the back, legs and face of the
                chair
                are integrated without insignificant details.</br></br>

                Office chairs have elastic backs for alleviating back pain caused by sedentary working hours; student
                chairs
                are simple and strong for bulk purchase; sofas are soft and spacious for rest. As Horatio Greenough
                said,
                “form follows function”, spun chairs were made for fun. The cone-shape bottoms serve the function as
                toys.
                </br></br>
                Additionally, design guides users’ behavior. The back of the office chair leans forward to make the
                staffs
                close to their desks and improve work efficiency; the student chairs are hard, forcing the students to
                concentrate; the soft sofa makes people want to lie down unconsciously. The spun chairs lead people
                having
                fun on it, but they won’t lay down and take a nap because there is no back. Also, the chairs’ unique
                exteriors give people a strong hint that they are supposed to be put in the living room as ornaments.
                </br></br>
                At first, I felt that the design without the back of the chair was a flaw, because when I wanted to rest
                and
                lean back, there was nothing to support my head, so I had to sit upright. However, when my friend
                complained
                about the inconvenience of his new high-tech kettle, I realized that the extra design might not be a
                good
                one. My friend said that although his kettle could connect to his cell phone via Bluetooth, he was
                confused
                by the additional features. "I don't have time to play with a kettle," he said. Dieter Rams's mention
                that
                good designs are streamlined in his design principles. Therefore, spun chairs eliminates redundant
                functions
                and restricts the use of chairs to sitting straight and rotating, which is actually a smart design.

            <div id="content">Magis Spun Chair is a typical postmodernism design object which allows the users using it
                in
